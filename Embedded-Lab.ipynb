    "Imagine you have been contracted by an aerospace company who is developing the sensor feedback systems for a plane. To reduce signal complexity, they decided to have one dedicated microcontroller collect temperatures along the entire fuselage in the wings. Based on these readings it will send a single analog signal if it heats up beyond 30C. They have provide the datasheet for the temperature sensors they're using, the XHC5140E"

    "An essential first step in developing firmwave is to understand the physical arrangement of the components you'll be controlling. Along the fuselage there are 4 independent temperature sensors, off the shelf XHC5140Es, all wired into a multiplexer (MUX), a device that takes in multiple wires and routes it to one. You choose the input channel that will be read out via selection pins by signaling the channel number in binary. For this lab, your micro controller will have 3 relevant GPIO that it must manage: the temperature in and the MUX select bits. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the function below you will implement this selection process. You will take in a channel parameter and correctly set your GPIO pins such that your MUX will route the value on that channel. To access the pins on your MCU use the Hardware Abstraction Library (HAL) functions provided, use the names selA and selB as your pin names"

You can use the HAL function for the Analog to Digital Converter to read the numerical value of the voltage. The ADC is a peripheral, meaning it has its own hardware converter, external to the CPU that writes the value to a reserved portion of the MCU memory.
